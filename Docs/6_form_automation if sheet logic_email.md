- Create a workflow.
- Add a trigger that activates when a specific event occurs.
- The workflow performs an initial step and reads data from the spreadsheet.
- Then add an IF condition that checks for true or false.
- If the condition is true, the workflow follows the first path.
- In this path, add a new column called Age to the given data.
- Then create another spreadsheet named Old and connect it to this path.
- If the condition is false, the workflow follows the alternate path.
- Create another spreadsheet named Young and attach it to the alternate path.
- The process completes when either of the two conditions is met.
- First, the trigger starts the process, sending the data to the sheet and then to the IF condition.
- If the condition is true, it executes the first path; otherwise, it executes the alternate path.
